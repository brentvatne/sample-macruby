Instructions to get up and running
----------------------------------

### Install MacRuby

If you have Mac OSX Lion, this is actually very easy - just install MacRuby 0.10 from the binary available on [the official downloads site](http://www.macruby.org/downloads.html). You will probably need XCode installed.

### Play around with the terminal

For MacRuby, {`irb` => `macirb`, `ruby` => `macruby`}

### Run the example

`macruby app.rb`

You should see a dialog with a single button. When you click the button,
an alert will appear. It may be behind the terminal window.
